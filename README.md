## About

This is my fifth web project created within [Practicum100](https://practicum.yandex.com) program by [Yandex](https://www.yandex.com)

## Technical Details

The project is created by using __HTML__,  __CSS__ and __JavaScript__. Its structure is based on __BEM__ methodology. A responsive layout is applied to make it look nice and display correctly on various screen sizes. I did my best to make it fit the design provided by [Practicum100](https://practicum.yandex.com) in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
